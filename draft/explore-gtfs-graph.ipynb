    "Transit networks have special characteristics deviating from normal networks (for example, the street network). They include:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable edge weights by schedule and real-time factors\n",
    "\n",
    "It is straightforward to consider \"edges\" in a transit network as the rides between stops, and the weights of these edges are the associated travel times. However, travel times may vary\n",
    "\n",
    "- By schedule: the GTFS dictates the schedule of bus speeds, which may vary by time of day, day of week, or other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Actual traffic situations: Even if a GTFS schedule dictates certain travel speeds, it **may not** be worthwhile to stringently follow scheduled departure/arrival times, as the actual travel speeds are dependent on many other factors. Therefore, sometimes it might be enough to just used more simplified travel times for certain periods, especially for more frequent transit services. The errors or deviation from using this approach from the actual condition are not necessarily larger than estimations using exact schedules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problems with transfers\n",
    "\n",
    "When building the transit network in a more traditional way, we may consider \"stops\" to be nodes, and \"rides\" to be edges. A typical path finding algorithm may want to find the shortest path between nodes by minimizing the sum of edge weights. However, there are two problems with this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In most cases, riders avoid transfers as much as possible, and for most \"nodes\" in a path, the rider would simply continue on the same trip, without even making the decision whether to switch. The critical decisions in path finding are only made at a small number of nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transfers are not \"weightless\". They take time for the next available bus to arrive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trade-off between accuracy, computation complexity, and schedule disruptions\n",
    "\n",
    "One possible solution to the above problems is to build a \"time-expanded\" network: rather than considering each geographic stop as a node, we consider each *event* of departure or arrival at each stop across the day as separate **nodes**, and **edges** include not just rides between stops, but also the stopping events and transfers that happen between stops. Theoretically, this could simulate the operation of the transit system in the most accurate way. However, this approach also has the following problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computation complexity. The number of nodes and edges in the network would be much larger than the original network, and the computation complexity would be much higher. This is especially true when we are not just calculating for occasional path finding, but for a large number of OD pairs to measure the connectivity of the entire network.\n",
    "- Schedule disruptions. Real-time disruptions may render all the extral computational work not worthwhile, as real-time conditions often cause discrepancies between the scheduled and actual arrival/departure events, which are not necessarily smaller than the discrepancies from using a simplified estimation method (i.e., using a fixed travel speed or headway for a given period).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing connections between nearby stops\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless if we consider \"stops\" as nodes or \"events\" as nodes, some connections always tend to be missed, that is, the connections between stops where no riding connections are available, but accessible by walking under certain minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Hybrid Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Trading off the benefits and drawbacks of different network-building techniques, we propose a hybrid approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two Networks**: we build both a time-expanded network, which considers each event as a node, and a simplified space-expanded network (maybe two for morning and evening peaks). The time-expanded network is used for the path finding between single or a small number of OD pairs with exact departure times. The space-expanded network is used for the path finding between a large number of OD pairs, for which the departure times are not necessarily exact. The latter approach is used to measure the connectivity of the entire network or between city districts by averaging travel times between a large number of OD pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Walking Connections**: apart from \"ride\" edges, and \"wait\" and \"transfer\" edges for the time-expanded network, we add additional \"walk\" edges between stops that are within a certain walking distance. This is to ensure that the path finding algorithm can find the shortest path between any two stops, even if there is no riding connection between them."
